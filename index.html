								<p> I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the University of Notre Dame.
								I earned my B.S. at the University of Perugia, where I also earned my M.S.
								My research interests mostly focus on Core-Collapse Supernovae, i.e. the 
								explosion of massive stars. More specifically, I am interested in the role
								that General Relativity, the Nuclear Equation of State and neutrino physics
								have in triggering the explosion. </p>

								<h2>Most recent work</h2>
								<p> Currently I'm working on developing a model for proto-neutron star convection, but I am still at the early stages of this, so I don't have much to say. One thing that is important to note is that current models based on mixing-length theory are not very good at predicting several properties of convection, and therefore it's time to improve on it! Before that I have just submitted a <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220708361B/abstract">paper</a> where I developed a criterion that predicts the outcome of the supernova based on the pre-collapse density profile of the progenitor star. Its accuracy is >90%, which is not bad. It works for progenitor stars modeled with both FRANEC and KEPLER codes. This is quite remarkable, because it shows that all that matters is the density profile right before collapse. However, when one looks at the explodability vs. initial mass it looks very different for FRANEC and KEPLER progenitors. This means that for example a 13 solar mass star in FRANEC is different than a 13 solar mass star in KEPLER. So in future 3D supernova simulations one should take this into account, and not simply use KEPLER progenitors like it's currently done!

									<h4>The role of the Si/O interface in the explodability of CCSNe </h4>
									<p>Simulations of core-collapse supernovae start when the iron core of the star is unstable, and therefore it collapses. One must therefore model the evolution of the star from its birth up to when it starts collapsing. This is usually done using a stellar evolution code. The supernova simulation then picks up when the stellar evolution code stops. In this <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220708361B/abstract">paper</a> I analyzed the impact of using pre-collapse models from two different stellar evolution codes: KEPLER and FRANEC. Usually, in the supernova community most groups almost always use KEPLER progenitors, because historically they were the first models comoputed. However, I showed that using progenitors from different stellar evolution codes can massively change the results. </p>

									Above you can see how the explodability pattern depends on the initial mass of the star at birth (the ZAMS mass). You can see that there are bands for different values of &alpha. They basically represent how strong neutrino-driven convection is, but don't worry too much about it, just focus on &alpha=1.51. Green corresponds to explosions and blue corresponds to failed supernovae. You can see how the low-mass FRANEC models explode more readily than the KEPLER models, whereas around 22 solar masses KEPLER progenitors explode whereas FRANEC progenitors don't. Therefore, the supernova community should soon start analyzing the effects of changing the input models of their calculations, because they clearly have a huge effect of the explosion. In this same <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220708361B/abstract">paper</a> I also developed a criterion that predicts whether a star explodes based on its density profile right before it collapses. It's pretty cool because it's a relatively simple model, and it tells you if your star is gonna blow up or not without the need of doing the simulation. It's not perfect of, but the accuracy is around 90%, which is very good for such a simple model! The idea is that near the silicon-oxygen interface there is a big density drop. When this is accreted through the shock, suddenly the density goes down, and therefore it's easier for the shock to expand, because there's less stuff pushing it down. Combined with neutrino-driven turbulence that pushes the shock from below, sometimes this leads to an explosion, depending how big is the density drop. This is my favorite result so far, because I was able to develop a simple, physically consistent criterion from start to finish. It also has very interesting implications, and shows that including neutrino-driven convection is crucial to obtain the correct explodability. Lastly, it agrees with results obtained by the 2D simulations of the Pronceton group, who indipendently developed a very similar criterion to mine.
