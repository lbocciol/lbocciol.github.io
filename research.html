									<h4>Background</h4>
									<p> The physics of Supernovae <p/>
									</header>

									<p> A Core-Collapse Supernova (CCSN) is an extremely energetic explosion that happens at the end of the life of a massive star. 
									It is effectively the <em>death</em> of a star. If you want to know more about Supernovae, check out 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">this awesome website</a> 
									that took me years to find, and now is my go-to for any science information I'm looking for.

									<p> The computational aspect of Supernovae <p/>
									</header>

									CCSNe are extremely complicated environments, since they are affected by forces that act on <em>macroscopic</em> scales (like <b>gravity</b>) and forces 
									that act on <em>microscopic</em> scales (like the <b>electroweak force</b> and the <b>strong force</b>). To undersand the physics behind them
									one has to unquestionably rely on numerical simulations. But that's not the end of the story! If you want to reliably simulate
									an explosion, you need to use some of the most powerful supercomputers available, and even then it takes millions of CPU hours to 
									do it. An alterantive is to simplify the problem (I guess that's basically 99% of what Physicists do) and, for example, pretend that the 
									star is perfectly spherically symmetric. That's what I do, and it might be surprising, but simply by doing that one cuts down the cost of
									a simulation to <em>hours</em> rather than <em>millions of hours</em>. Keep scrolling if you want to know all the cool things that can be done
									even with such a simplified model!<p/>

									<h4>The role of neutrino-driven turbulent convection in CCSNe </h4>
									<p>Neutrino-driven turbulent convection is very important and I'll tell you about it when I have more time</p>
									<hr />

									<h4>The role of General Relativity in CCSNe </h4>
									<p>I wrote a <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...29B/abstract">paper</a>  about it. I would also describe the paper to you but I have other things to do.</p>
									<hr />

									<h4>The role of the Nuclear Equation of State in CCSNe </h4>
									<p>I wrote <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05544">another paper</a> about it. I would also describe the paper to you but I have the other <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...29B/abstract">paper</a> to describe first.</p>
									<hr />

									<h4>The role of the PNS convection in CCSNe </h4>
									<p>This is work in progress. Maybe I'll show you a couple of plots after I'll have this Website presentable</p>
